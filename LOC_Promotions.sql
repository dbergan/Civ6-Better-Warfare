('LOC_PEDIA_UNITPROMOTIONS_PAGE_BW_PROMOTION_HEAVY_INFANTRY_PHALANX_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1', 'The phalanx was a formation in which the heavy infantry would line up in ranks in close order. The soldiers would lock their shields together, and the first few ranks would project their spears out over the first rank of shields. The phalanx therefore presented a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults against it very difficult. It also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the front rank).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. One of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. The formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. Herodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of Marathon, that "They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy at a run". Historians believe that this innovation was to minimize their losses from Persian archery.', 'en_US'),

The commander concentrates the majority of their strength (elite units and/or a greater quantity of troops) on one flank while the remainder fixes the enemy line. This technique allows a commander with weaker or equal total forces to achieve a quick local superiority in numbers on one side and then snowball that advantage down the rest of the line.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the oblique order attack, the line is intentionally thinner on one side in order to concentrate troops on the other side. Then, when meeting the opposing heavy infantry, they would then create an angled (oblique) engagement with the enemy, refusing complete engagement on the weakened flank, but attacking in full on the stronger flank with a concentration of force. Once the strong flank had dominated its oppososition, the commander would wheel the troops 90 degrees to roll up the enemy line.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first recorded use of this sort of tactic was in 371 BCE at the Battle of Leuctra, in Greece, when the Thebans under Epaminondas defeated the Spartans by highly enforcing one flank to fifty rows deep, rather than spreading forces parsimoniously. Philip of Macedon learned Epaminondas'' technique while held prisoner at Thebes, and his descendants (including Alexander), used it in their campaigns. King Frederick II of Prussia also particularly favored this tactic.', 'en_US'),

As the stirrup had not been invented at the time of the Parthians, the rider relied solely on pressure from his legs to guide his horse.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to the Parthians, this tactic was used by most nomads of the Eurasian steppe, including the Scythians, Huns, Turks, Magyars, and Mongols. The technique was used to great effect in Parthia''s victory over the Rome in the Battle of Carrhae where 20,000 Romans were killed (and another 10,000 captured) compared to Parthia''s loss of only a few dozen horses.

Though the used mount would still have to travel, it would do so without the weight of the rider. Their ability to live off the land, and in extreme situations off their animals (mare''s milk especially), made their armies far less dependent on the traditional logistical apparatus of agrarian armies. In some cases, as during the invasion of Hungary in early 1241, they covered up to 100 miles (160 km) per day, which was unheard of by other armies of the time. The horse was viewed much like a cow in Mongolia; milked and slaughtered for meat as such. Since most of the Mongols'' mounts were mares, they were able to live off their horses'' milk or milk products as they moved through enemy territory. In dire straits, the Mongol warrior could drink some of the blood from his string of remounts. They could survive a whole month only by drinking mare''s milk combined with mare''s blood.', 'en_US'),
